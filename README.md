Project Title :
**Data Transmission through Light (Li-Fi)**   - APPROVED
comment: which use case will you use to demonstrate this technology implementation? Has to be a practical one that is easy to understand and consume. 

Project description

Li-Fi can be considered as a light-based Wi-Fi. It uses light instead of radio waves to transmit information. Li-Fi is transmission of data using illumination i.e. sending data through an LED lamp that varies intensity of light faster than what human eye can perceive. The merits of Li-fi to that of Wi-fi are that High data transmission rates of up to 10Gbps can be achieved, since light cannot penetrate walls, it provides privacy and security that Wi-Fi cannot, Li-Fi has low implementation and maintenance costs and unlike Wi-Fi, Li-Fi emits no radiation.

We propose a system which contains a combination of multiple Light emitting diode and a photovoltaic cell which will be used to transmit and receive data respectively. As Li-Fi works in light spectrum bandwidth is greater and the speeds is much larger. Our proposed system aims to send data such as music(sound), pictures, textual data through the light spectrum.

The applications of the system is best suited for indoor large data hungry establishments like colleges, offices, factories and hospitals. Radio waves do not work underwater, Li-Fi do.
