Project Title:
**Roomie Sync**

Project description:

Residents living in the same apartment have to access a lot of different portals for their daily or monthly requirements such as bill payments, ordering groceries and daily needs. There are various portals, websites or services that can be used to cater all these needs. Examples include utility bill payment, rent payment, PG&E payment, WiFi payment, mobile bill payment and ordering groceries from Store2K, Walmart, Costco and many more.

It becomes really difficult for the residents or roommates to keep a track of all these services or portals on a daily basis and can cost them dollars if they miss out on paying the rent or utility bill.

Here is where Roomie Sync comes into picture. Roomie Sync provides an Unified Endpoint Management for all the common utility services. It is a platform and a single pane of glass for all these services. Residents living in the same apartment will Sign up for a same account on Roomie Sync and will add all the common services to this tool, that they subscribe to.

All residents will have a single view of all these services. A single account will cater to a group of all the residents living together.

As all portals/services will be listed in the same view, the authorized users can easily navigate to these portals without having to remember or bookmark them.

Members of the group will get consolidated notifications and reminders from the tool about upcoming bill payment deadlines of the services that have been added to this tool. Roomie Sync will maintain a history and will keep a track of all details of the goods or groceries ordered in the previous months so that the users donâ€™t have to remember the monthly stuff that they order in common.

Roomie Sync will also provide easily configurable, flexible dashboards so users can see the information they need the way they need to see it (graphs, calenders, alerts, etc.), and users can quickly set it up.

Project Title:
**Electric Scooter Perfect Parking**

Project description:

The idea is to implement a feature in these electric scooters like lime/ bird which will only allow the scooter trip to end only when the scooter is parked parallel to the street.

These days, as the electric scooters are taking off in our society the problem of mis-parked scooters blocking the footpaths is rising proportionally. This idea can help scooters to be parked properly and will help companies provide their electric scooter services without causing blockages on footpaths for pedestrians.

We will make use of GPS to find location and the direction of the scooter. The scooter will be locked only when this direction is parallel to the street it's on. As parking perpendicular to the street causes blockage on the footpath.

Project Title :

**Data Transmission through Light (Li-Fi)**

Project description

Li-Fi can be considered as a light-based Wi-Fi. It uses light instead of radio waves to transmit information. Li-Fi is transmission of data using illumination i.e. sending data through an LED lamp that varies intensity of light faster than what human eye can perceive. The merits of Li-fi to that of Wi-fi are that High data transmission rates of up to 10Gbps can be achieved, since light cannot penetrate walls, it provides privacy and security that Wi-Fi cannot, Li-Fi has low implementation and maintenance costs and unlike Wi-Fi, Li-Fi emits no radiation.

We propose a system which contains a combination of multiple Light emitting diode and a photovoltaic cell which will be used to transmit and receive data respectively. As Li-Fi works in light spectrum bandwidth is greater and the speeds is much larger. Our proposed system aims to send data such as music(sound), pictures, textual data through the light spectrum.

The applications of the system is best suited for indoor large data hungry establishments like colleges, offices, factories and hospitals. Radio waves do not work underwater, Li-Fi do.
